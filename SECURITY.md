## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this project is a priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate you letting us know responsibly.

We will respond as soon as possible (usually within 48 hours) to confirm receipt of your report. We will keep you informed about the progress of the investigation and the actions we take. We thank you for your patience and collaboration in keeping this project secure.
